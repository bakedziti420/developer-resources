# Orientation

## Why is this important?
Make sure everyone has a similar development environment and a similar expectations around how the course will run.

## What are the objectives
- List some of the common checks for understanding
- Describe the schedule for a normal day of training 
- List the ways to communicate with the instructors
- Understand the assessment structure of the course
- Create a development environment on your local machine

## Name Game(5 mins)
We'll start with some quick name games
- Say your name and one place other than Denver that you'd like to live
- Say your name and favorite movie or book

Consultants will try to name everyone.

## Class Expectations(20 mins)

*** Checks for Understanding (CFUs)

One of the things, you'll notice about the trainings is that we'll chop them up and ask you individual questions and 
make sure everyone is keeping up. We'll be using several techniques and tools to look at how the whole class is doing 
and one of those techniques is called the fist of five. Everyone holds up between 0 and 5 fingers depending on how they
feel. We'll typically use fist of 5 in two cases to check on how you understand some piece of content or to check on 
agreement

Value | Learning  					 | Agreement
----- | -----------------------------| -----  
0     | Did I walk into wrong class? | I am offended by this
1     | I need help                             | I have strong reservations
2     | I think I need some help                             | I have a few reservations
3     | I understand  	 | I'm OK with this
4     | I think I can teach this                        	 | Not the best idea, but close
5     | I can teach this 	 | That was my idea!

Another tool, we'll be using is the "Aha Board". This board is located _____. The way to use the board is whenever you 
suddenly get something, whenever you have that Aha or light bulb moment please get up an put the topic on this board. 
It can be anything in course even if its not related to current topic and might have been something we covered a few 
weeks ago.

## Schedule 

The typical schedule for Monday through Thursday looks like
#### Daily Schedule Overview

Time  | Monday - Thursday  			| Friday
----- | ------------------ 			| -----  
9:15  | Module 1           			| Review
10:45 | Module 2           			| Outcomes
12:30 | Lunch              			| Lunch
1:30  | Module 3           			| Review
3:00  | Module 4           			| Begin Weekend Lab
4:30  | One-on-ones/Training start 	| Rest

Each module is more of a training section or a lab section. They'll run about 75 mintues each and then we'll have a 
quick break. If you need to step out of the room for a bathroom break or a phone call feel free to during the class.

We'll have a detailed schedule up for the next week up by the end of the Friday of the week before. The schedule is 
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/den-wdi-1/schedule). We'll fill in the 
links for the specifc lesson plans at the beginning of the day. 

<!--
[comment]: <> (We're not putting the lesson plans up because we're going to be making small or larger tweaks as we go through the course. For example if we're coming back on working on something that caused some confusion the first time we looked at, we're going to include some more review before the new material and we don't want to throw anyone off who looked at the material early.)

## Slack

Feel free use ``#wdi-den-1__placeholder`` for any conversations outside of lectures for general content questions or 

There are also general WDI conversations in Slack on 

## Consultant Communications

One of the most important things that you'll learn in this course is how to work out how developers learn things. 
Ultimately this will be a Read Search Ask policy. 
- Read the instructions and/or documentations
- Search using Google, and finally
- Ask. 
When we start out, the consultants will answer more traditional questions at the start when everyone is 

Slack has a great feature like twitter that if you use ``@zebgiround`` or ``@jpbarela`` in the ``#wdi-den-1`` channel, 
we automatically get notified of that message. Putting content questions in the Slack channel has several benefits:
- other developers might have the same question(s) and we can help everyone at the same time
- other developers in the class might have worked through issue and might be able to help before the consultants can
answer
The consultants will review Slack each night for questions and

There are also a number of ways to work directly with the consultants. We take 1-1 appointments after class Monday 
through Thursday. We might combine 1-1s into a small group if several people approach with the same issue.

Consultants can take direct messages for other non-content related issues. Direct messages are a great way to schedule 
a 1-1 or talk about any issue that you're not comfortable talking about in public channel.

## Assessments
General thoughts on assessments:
The best way to program is to program. Try things out. Make mistakes and fix them. One of the great advantages of 
programming is that you can gain your 10,000 hours of practice in similar groups and self-direction. If you follow some 
of the tips and work flows we go 

Also, if the computer does what you want it to do, you've succeeded. The consultants may point out easier 

## Staying Healthy

**Sleep** Getting a reasonable amount of sleep (9 hours if that's what you need) is important and let that help guide 
you in working through material and getting work done.

**Exercise** Getting out for some exercise everyday will help you learn so don't be afraid to take some time for 
exercise.

**Family/Free time** The course moves fast and it will take a lot of time but don't feel bad if you take time for family
or just take a break. You'll find you can make more progress when you come back.

<!--
[comment]: <> (These things are important and if you can work through a good balance of the three first assessments and staying focused on the coursework, you'll make more progress than just trying to push through trying to get all the coursework done. Also help with your other developers in recognizing when they might need to devote more time to the first three assessments)
-->

**Initial 1-1** will take place the second week of the course and are required. These meetings are to help the 
consultants to understand any early challenges, look at your goals, and help make sure the class is a great experience.  
Let us know if need to schedule a 1-1 closer to the end of class to meet other commitments but some of these meetings 
might go until 5:30.

## Work and Feedback

**Homework** will be reviewed by Thomas every night. If you have specific questions around homework we'll have some time
 in the morning, on Slack, or during 1-1's for questions around homework. Finishing the homework is the ideal but we've
 chosen to write the homeworks in a way that will make them a good future reference and sometimes this may be more than 
 you can do. If you're spending four hours on a homework and not making much progress, think about submitting what you 
 have done and moving on to something else.

Please submit all of the homeworks. Even if you don't make much progress on a homework please submit the homework as 
that's important feedback on what you understand and also how we're doing.

**Labs** will not reviewed but questions that come up after the lab can come through Slack and 1-1s. Labs are similar 
to homework in the sense that we're writing them to be good references on the topic and sometimes there may be more work
than you can do.

**Projects** will include a rubic, or a predefined set of standards that will be evaluated. For projects 1-3, the 
consultants will go through your code and highlight any specific issues that we see to help you understand how to write 
better code. The consultants will also have a 1-1 with each developer where we go through the rubic and celebrate your 
progress in the rubic and help work through any issues.
