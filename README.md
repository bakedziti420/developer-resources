# Orientation

## Why is this important?
Make sure everyone knows the best places to look for information, and what they will see in these places.

## What are the objectives
- **List** the usual resources for developer help on the web
- **Describe** the types of information available at these resources

## How to Google:

  - Include the language or library you are using
  - Check out the search tools 'past year'

  - For example: "javascript foreach object"

  - Google the exact error:
    - `ReferenceError: alert is not defined`


  - Look for three main kinds of solutions:

    1. Documentation
    2. Stack Overflow and other crowd sourced answers
    3. Blogs

## Documentation

### Javascript

There are many resources that contain Javascript documentation online.  Below are the most popular:

1. [MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
2. [W3Schools (World Wide Web Schools)](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

## Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a crowd-sourced answering platform.  If someone has an issue that Google can't help them solve, they post on Stack Overflow.  That way, when other people try to search Google for a solution, they find one on Stack Overflow.

There are several similar, affiliated Stack Question-and-Answer channels online as well, like [SuperUser](http://superuser.com/) for IT questions.
